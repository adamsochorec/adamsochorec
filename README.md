## What?  
A personal portfolio website showcasing **photography, web projects, animations, and a travel blog**.  

## Why?  
The goal was to create a **pixel-perfect, minimalist, and clean** website while experimenting with **DOM manipulation, vanilla JavaScript, and reusable PHP components**. This project helped refine coding practices by minimizing dependencies and optimizing performance.  

## When?  
Developed gradually from **May 2022 to December 2023**.  

## Who?  
Created by [Adam Sochorec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsochorec) as a personal project.  

## How?  
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript**, avoiding jQuery by rewriting functions for efficiency.  
- Utilized **PHP for reusable components**, **scoped CSS**, and **CSS variables** for styling.  
- The **Cybersecurity project** ([GitHub](https://github.com/adamsochorec/cybersecurity)) influenced the site's core visual identity.  
- Over time, the site expanded into a **portfolio and blog section**.  
- Served as the foundation for later projects like **[slavicmedia.dk](https://github.com/adamsochorec/slavicmedia.dk)**, which followed a similar component-based structure.
