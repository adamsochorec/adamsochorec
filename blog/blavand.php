          On the 12th of April, I woke up early and packed a backpack with lunch
          before heading to the Kolding train station. I took a train to Oksbøl,
          which is located near Blåvand, the westernmost city in Denmark. My
          plan was to visit the

            >Blåvand Lighthouse</a
          >
          local lighthouse, about a 35-minute walk from the bus station. At the
          time, Blåvand was hosting a festival and the main road through the
          city was congested with cars with Danish and German license plates.

        <p>
          I stopped at a local fisherman's shop to buy a shrimp salad from a
          bakery and began walking. The town center of Blåvand is not large and
          it wasn't long before I reached an area with dozens of summer houses
          surrounded by pine trees. As I neared the shore, the vacation homes
          gave way to standalone houses built in the dunes a few meters from the
          sea.

          According to my navigation app, I had about 20 minutes left on my
          walk. As I walked along the

          that borders Germany to the south and flows into the

          screeching, as well as children playing on the WWII bunkers built as
          part of the

          during the war. I noticed that these bunkers were spaced about every
          few hundred meters along the entire west coast. However, "standing"
          might not be the right term to describe their condition. After more
          than half a century of neglect in the sand, these bunkers had sunken
          into the ground.

          Their exteriors were often covered in graffiti and some even had
          additional metal constructions shaped like horses or giraffes. As I
          passed more and more bunkers, each with its own unique design and
          level of deterioration, I had the idea to scan them using a 3D
          modeling app called
          <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://poly.cam"
            >Polycam</a

          While the app's scanning and processing options are not the most
          advanced, it is user-friendly and convenient to use. There are also
          several ways to use the app for free, such as creating user profiles
          and sharing scanned content.

          When I reached the lighthouse, I bought a ticket to the top of the
          tower from a small house that was probably used to house the
          lighthouse crew. The view from the top was surreal, with dunes covered
          in grass of varying colors and narrow paths running through them. The
          landscape reminded me of the planet

          Later, as I browsed the souvenir shop, I saw a large selection of
          <a
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber"
            >amber</a
          >
          necklaces and jewelry. The elderly woman behind the cashier's desk
          told me that with a bit of luck, I might be able to find some amber on
          the beach. As I walked along the west coast, I noticed that the Danish
          military liked to train in the stratified terrain in the area
          surrounding Blåvand. The beach and sand fields to the northeast had
          several watchtowers, as well as other military facilities such as
          antennas and small storage units. Yellow signs warned of military
          areas and fencing marked off the training grounds.<br /><br />Overall,
          my visit to Blåvand was a unique and memorable experience. The WWII
          bunkers, now used as playgrounds by children, were a poignant reminder
          of the past, and the natural beauty of the west coast was
          breathtaking. In addition, I would also recommend visiting nearby
