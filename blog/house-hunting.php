          project, and Hido's narrative style of documenting the past by
          capturing the current state or remnants of abandoned buildings.

          In the past, I tried several times to apply the inspiration I gained
          from Hiddo's works to lonely constructions in Czechia and Denmark.
          Even though the exterior atmosphere was slightly more matching to the
          one that Hido works with - lonely lights, night, and fog often
          captured through long exposure on a medium format camera, I felt that
          this time I was the closest to Hido's world.

          On one of my walks in the neighborhood of Palosaari, in Finnish Vaasa,
          I couldn't help but notice the beautiful pale green colour of a
          low-key, old-fashioned family house. Upon closer inspection, I saw
          broken windows and a damaged entrance staircase, indicating that the
          building was uninhabited. The building immediately sparked my
          photographer's instinct and I saw an opportunity to experiment with
          new elements in a style I had been working with.
        </p>
        <div class="img">
          <img
            src="/img/22100983968852.jpg"
            alt="Photo taken from a plan view of an old wooden narrow staircase. The staircase leads from the ground floor to the first floor."
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Beforehand, I contacted the city planning department to gather
          information about the property. We discovered that the building was
          marked for demolition, so my initial plan of taking photos to be used
          by the <i>Cheap Old Houses</i> initiative to save the building was
          dashed. However, there is still hope as the Ostrobothnian Museum will
          likely be consulted before a demolition permit is issued due to the
          building's age and potential historical value.

          and I agreed to photograph the inside of the building at sunrise on an
          early autumn morning.<br />
          We were able to explore the interior of the building and photograph
          the bleached spots on the walls, likely left by previously hanging
          frames and paintings. Despite the building's impending demolition, we
          were able to document its beauty and history through our photography.
