          capital and the largest city before starting our journey of discovery
          from south to north. We followed a rule of thumb to take a short break
          every 45-60 minutes to stretch, eat some sugar or protein, and
          hydrate. This helped us to maintain our performance and motivation
          over the long haul.

          camp on the banks of Lake LÃ¥ngsjÃ¶n. Right in the morning we had to
          change our plans when we learned that the local ferry we were supposed
          to take back from the north tip of the islands only operates during
          the summer.<br />Our original plan to walk over 100km in five days,
          from south to north through the eastern hemisphere of the most
          inhabited island,

          hitchhiking and seeing as much as possible. We were able to reach the
          Djupviksgrottan cave by the evening of the second day with the help of
          two hitchhiking rides.

          After saying goodbye to our last ferryman, we embarked on a journey
          through the western part of the islands. We walked and hitchhiked
          along the coast, taking in the beautiful scenery and meeting friendly
          locals. One of the highlights of the trip was visiting the lighthouse
          at the north tip of the islands. On the way back, we stopped at the

          Before leaving the cave, Marcel and I scouted the surrounding
          countryside and were surprised to discover fancy-looking and
          well-equipped cottages just a few hundred meters above the cave,
          seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Later that day, we were back on
          our feet, walking on the red roads that are common on the Ã…land
          Islands, passing rural settlements and farms, and seeking rides once
          again.

          This time, our carriers were two fresh-looking wanderers we had talked
          with earlier that day in the cave (the only males who stopped for us
          during our entire journey!) We exchanged stories and tips with
          strangers in their cars, squeezed into the rear seats. On our way to
          the capital in the south, our paths split in Godby. As before, we
          resupplied with groceries, recharged our lithium batteries, chilled in
          the lobby, and reviewed our strategy.

          It was just the second day of our expedition, and we had already
          reached our final destination. We decided to conquer the east of the
          archipelago territory as a plan for our remaining two days. To our
          disappointment, as soon as we finished our planning and got ready to
          continue, a violent storm with intense rain occurred. Despite fate's
          unwillingness, we proceeded further into darkness, far away from the
          city lights, still hoping for a ride.

          After an hour of struggling to attract passing drivers with smiles and
          hand waves, when it seemed that Ã…landers were cold-hearted and without
          mercy for trespassing foreigners, a Nissan unnoticed our presence
          pulled over a few dozen meters away. As soon as we realized what had
          happened, we sprinted towards the car cheering. The lonely driver,
          Karolina, offered us hot tea and a promise of warming up in her nearby
          house.

          Later that evening we met most likely her entire family including
          cats, dogs, and chickens. Karolina's tribe made all of us wanderers
          feel as welcome as being back home and still being thousands of
          kilometers far away. The original tea break extended into a deep
          discussion and storytelling over dinner, with stoves heating our
          backs, with Karolina, the head of the tribe, Thomas, and their
          daughter Frida. When Andreas, Marcel, and I agreed that our hosts were
          truly generous to strangers, we were offered a sleepover (and bed!)
          and the keys to their car for the following day. We humbly accepted
          the given offerings and went to sleep like babies. Our third day began
          with the sound of the family's rooster and with both homemade yogurt
          and eggs.

          truly spiritual archipelago and had a remarkable land view of our
          surroundings from a nearby tower and cuddled with a flock of curious
          sheep, we returned to our temporary basecamp to borrow a car and
          wander further east, over the red roads, which were from time to time
          replaced by car ferries, to the end of the road on

          of one hand when it came time for goodbye to our hosts in the evening,
          it felt like leaving a good old friend after a long time of not seeing
          each other. Despite not having an opportunity to repay the generosity
          of the family who took us in, I couldn't help but think that they were
          simply repaying a debt to someone else. The idea is that if I provide
          for others, my debt to the universe will be repaid and someone else
          will be treated with kindness.

          Our final task was to make it back to Mariehamn. We had no luck with
          hitchhiking, so after several hours of hiking through the empty red
          roads, we reached Godby, about 17km away, in the night and set up camp
          using a tarp on the banks of Lake LÃ¥ngsjÃ¶n, like the first night. The
          final day was spent with the goal of reaching Mariehamn in the evening
          and spending the last night in the forest between the city and the
          seashore.

          Despite feeling like we had overcome all obstacles, the last one was
          the rain that lasted throughout the night. Marcel, who slept under the
          open sky in just a sleeping bag, was especially hard hit and was
          soaked in the morning. My

          protected me from most of the rain, but some still got in. Andreas,
          who had wisely set up a modest tent using his tarp, was the driest of
          us in the morning. Unfortunately, the tarp tent did not cover his feet
          and the large open entrance allowed the rain to alt="Photo of Andreas

          and said goodbye. Marcel travelled back to Denmark via
