## What?

One of the very first personal websites by [Adam Sochorec](https://linkedin.com/in/adamsochorec), initially created as a school project focused on **web accessibility** and **cybersecurity**. Over time, it evolved into a **personal portfolio** showcasing photo, video, and 3D work, as well as a basic **blog** with travel stories and project updates.

## Why?

This project marked a major milestone in development experience. It introduced the concept of **reusable components** via PHP includes, enabling consistent headers and footers across the site without repeating code.

## When?

Development spanned from **2021 to 2023**, with continuous small updates and expansions.

## Who?

Developed independently by Adam Sochorec during studies at [IBA](https://www.iba.dk).

## How?

- Built in **static HTML, CSS, and PHP**
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Routing and structure are handled **manually**, without `.htaccess` or JS frameworks
- Served through local environments using **XAMPP/AMPPS**
- Used as a repository for early projects in **video, photo, and 3D**
